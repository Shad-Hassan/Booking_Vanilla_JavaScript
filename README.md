## About


- Hello ! I am a react developer , who barely uses DOM or vanilla JavaScript these days .
- A refreshing challenge on working with html , dom and vanilla JS after a while


## What its about ?

- Well , I mapped two arrays instead of trying to grid 50 buttons manually using tailwind (god forbid you ever try to make it static - like my boi [@md-maheen-billah](https://github.com/md-maheen-billah),
- The Challenge was , that I could only book four seats max while using vanilla JS and DOM (no more stateHook or prop abuse T_T )
- Duplicate Seats cant be booked , and thus me and my ordeal of nested JS functions (coz clean code is such a myth)
- I hope this helps you with DOM and JS interactiosn , do consider giving this repo a star if it helped :star2: :star2:
